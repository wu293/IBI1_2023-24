Human vs Mouse BLOSUM score: 3137.0, identity percentage: 92.54%
Human vs Rat BLOSUM score: 3107.0, identity percentage: 91.75%
Mouse vs Rat BLOSUM score: 3261.0, identity percentage: 96.83%
The greater the BLOSUM62 score and percentage identity is, the more similar their sequences are. So humans SLC6A4 gene sequence is more like the mouse than the rat.
Mouse would be a better model organism for studying variation in the SLC6A4 gene in humans.
